Thanks for visiting my website repository!
This website was made for learning & is not officially affiliated with Rusty's @ Cornell.
My goal was to famliarize myself w/Figma, Flex Display, and window resizing.

Notes to self:
1. Always set outer div size + min and max width
2. Inner items should use percentages for size
3. Rem often causes overflow
